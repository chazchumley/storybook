# Storybook to Drupal: Building front-end components

## Storybook is a tool that helps developers and designers build, test, and share UI components, like buttons, forms, and cardsâ€”outside of the main app.

## Development approach

At the core of the platform are the best practices and standards of today's development ecosystem.
The platform makes heavy use of the [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) methodology however it does not use the naming convention of such methodology. Instead, we have organized our patterns as follows:

### Patterns organization

* **Base**: These are the global pieces used across the project which include things like typography, colors, sizes, borders and more.
* **Components**: A modular unit of a user interface that encapsulates structure (HTML/Twig), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript/logic) into a single entity, which can be reused and composed with other components to build complex UIs.
* **Layouts**: Organizes content and components within a user interface, ensuring consistency, usability, and visual hierarchy.

## Tooling
The tooling for the platform has been carefully vetted and selected so only the absolute necessary is included. These tools include:

* [Vite](https://vite.dev/) (JS Edition)
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) (HTML Edition)
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Twig
* PostCSS
